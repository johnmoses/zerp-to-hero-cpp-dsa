A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).

Now consider if some obstacles are added to the grids. How many unique paths would there be?

An obstacle and space is marked as 1 and 0 respectively in the grid.

Input: obstacleGrid = [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,0]]
Output: 2

Explanation: There is one obstacle in the middle of the 3x3 grid above.
There are two ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Right -> Down -> Down
2. Down -> Down -> Right -> Right

Constraints:

m == obstacleGrid.length
n == obstacleGrid[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 100
obstacleGrid[i][j] is 0 or 1.

Solution

Approach 1: Dynamic Programming

Intuition

The robot can only move either down or right. Hence any cell in the first row can only be reached from the cell left to it.

For any other cell in the grid, we can reach it either from the cell to left of it or the cell above it.

If any cell has an obstacle, we won't let that cell contribute to any path.

We will be iterating the array from left-to-right and top-to-bottom. Thus, before reaching any cell we would have the number of ways of reaching the predecessor cells. This is what makes it a Dynamic Programming problem. We will be using the obstacleGrid array as the DP array thus not utilizing any additional space.

Note: As per the question, cell with an obstacle has a value 1. We would use this value to make sure if a cell needs to be included in the path or not. After that we can use the same cell to store the number of ways to reach that cell.

Algorithm

If the first cell i.e. obstacleGrid[0,0] contains 1, this means there is an obstacle in the first cell. Hence the robot won't be able to make any move and we would return the number of ways as 0.
Otherwise, if obstacleGrid[0,0] has a 0 originally we set it to 1 and move ahead.
Iterate the first row. If a cell originally contains a 1, this means the current cell has an obstacle and shouldn't contribute to any path. Hence, set the value of that cell to 0. Otherwise, set it to the value of previous cell i.e. obstacleGrid[i,j] = obstacleGrid[i,j-1]
Iterate the first column. If a cell originally contains a 1, this means the current cell has an obstacle and shouldn't contribute to any path. Hence, set the value of that cell to 0. Otherwise, set it to the value of previous cell i.e. obstacleGrid[i,j] = obstacleGrid[i-1,j]
Now, iterate through the array starting from cell obstacleGrid[1,1]. If a cell originally doesn't contain any obstacle then the number of ways of reaching that cell would be the sum of number of ways of reaching the cell above it and number of ways of reaching the cell to the left of it.
