Given a non-negative integer x, compute and return the square root of x.

Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are truncated, and only the integer part of the result is returned.

Note: You are not allowed to use any built-in exponent function or operator, such as pow(x, 0.5) or x ** 0.5

Integer Square Root

The value 
a
a we're supposed to compute could be defined as â‰¤x<(a+1) 2
 . It is called integer square root. From geometrical points of view, it's the side of the largest integer-side square with a surface less than x.
