An image is represented by an m x n integer grid image where image[i][j] represents the pixel value of the image.

You are also given three integers sr, sc, and newColor. You should perform a flood fill on the image starting from the pixel image[sr][sc].

To perform a flood fill, consider the starting pixel, plus any pixels connected 4-directionally to the starting pixel of the same color as the starting pixel, plus any pixels connected 4-directionally to those pixels (also with the same color), and so on. Replace the color of all of the aforementioned pixels with newColor.

Return the modified image after performing the flood fill.

Approach #1: Depth-First Search [Accepted]

Intuition

We perform the algorithm explained in the problem description: paint the starting pixels, plus adjacent pixels of the same color, and so on.

Algorithm

Say color is the color of the starting pixel. Let's floodfill the starting pixel: we change the color of that pixel to the new color, then check the 4 neighboring pixels to make sure they are valid pixels of the same color, and of the valid ones, we floodfill those, and so on.

We can use a function dfs to perform a floodfill on a target pixel.
