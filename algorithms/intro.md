# Algorithms

An algorithm is a set of step-by-step instructions to solve a given problem or achieve a specific goal.

An algorithm is a structured set of instructions designed to solve a problem or perform a computation. It operates by taking an input, processing it through a sequence of defined steps, and producing an output. Algorithms are fundamental in computer science, mathematics, and everyday tasks, serving as the backbone for data processing, calculations, and decision-making systems.

Key Features of Algorithms

 1. Finite Steps: Every algorithm consists of a finite number of steps that must be followed in a specific order.
 2. Input and Output: Algorithms require input data to process and produce output results.
 3. Deterministic or Randomized: While most algorithms follow deterministic steps, some incorporate randomness for certain computations.
 4. Automation: Algorithms can be executed manually or automatically by machines.

Applications

 1. Search Engines: Algorithms retrieve relevant information based on user queries.
 2. Social Media: They prioritize content in feeds based on user behavior and engagement.
 3. Navigation Systems: Algorithms calculate the most efficient routes between locations.
 4. Artificial Intelligence: Advanced algorithms enable systems to learn from data and make decisions autonomously.
In essence, algorithms are logical frameworks that guide problem-solving across various domains, ensuring efficiency and consistency in achieving desired outcomes.

Real-world examples
Algorithms are ubiquitous in modern life, powering systems that shape daily interactions and global operations. Below are key real-world examples across different domains:

1. Search Engines
Google’s PageRank Algorithm
Analyzes web page links to rank search results by relevance and authority. It evaluates how many quality sites link to a page to determine its importance.
Bing’s RankNet
Uses machine learning to rank results based on user behavior, such as click-through rates and dwell time.

2. Social Media
Facebook’s News Feed Algorithm
Prioritizes posts based on user engagement (likes, shares), relationships, and content type (video vs. text). It also suppresses low-quality or spam content.
TikTok’s For You Page
Uses collaborative filtering and content analysis to recommend videos. It tracks watch time, likes, and shares to personalize feeds.

3. Navigation Systems
Google Maps’ Routing Algorithm
Calculates optimal routes using real-time traffic data, road conditions, and historical patterns. It also considers user preferences like avoiding tolls.
Waze’s Crowd-Sourced Navigation
Relies on user-reported traffic incidents and speed data to dynamically adjust routes.

4. E-commerce
Amazon’s Recommendation Engine
Suggests products based on browsing history, purchase patterns, and collaborative filtering (e.g., “Customers who bought X also bought Y”).
Netflix’s Recommendation System
Uses matrix factorization and deep learning to predict user preferences, improving content discovery.

5. Financial Services
Credit Scoring Algorithms
Evaluate loan eligibility by analyzing payment history, income, and debt-to-income ratios. Examples include FICO and VantageScore.
High-Frequency Trading Algorithms
Execute trades in milliseconds using real-time market data and statistical models to exploit price discrepancies.

6. Healthcare
Diagnosis Algorithms
Analyze symptoms, medical history, and test results to suggest potential conditions. Tools like IBM Watson Health use natural language processing for this.
Drug Discovery Algorithms
Predict molecular interactions and optimize drug candidates using machine learning and quantum computing.

7. Music Streaming
Spotify’s Discover Weekly
Creates personalized playlists by analyzing listening habits, skips, and collaborative filtering.
Apple Music’s Mixes
Uses genre-based clustering and user behavior to curate playlists.

8. Fraud Detection
Banking Fraud Algorithms
Flag suspicious transactions by comparing spending patterns to historical data and geolocation.
Credit Card Fraud Detection
Identify anomalies in purchase frequency, amount, and location to block fraudulent activity.

9. Logistics
UPS’s ORION Algorithm
Optimizes delivery routes by analyzing traffic, fuel efficiency, and time windows, reducing miles driven by millions annually.
Amazon’s Warehouse Management
Uses predictive analytics to position inventory for faster order fulfillment and minimize shipping costs.

10. Artificial Intelligence
AlphaFold (Protein Prediction)
Predicts 3D protein structures using deep learning, revolutionizing drug discovery.
ChatGPT’s Language Model
Generates human-like text through transformer architecture and reinforcement learning.

We will start with a simple example of fibonacci numbers. The two first Fibonacci numbers are 0 and 1, and the next Fibonacci number is always the sum of the two previous numbers
