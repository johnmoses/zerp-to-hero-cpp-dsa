Given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, return an array of their intersection. Each element in the result must be unique and you may return the result in any order.

Example 1:

Input: nums1 = [1,2,2,1], nums2 = [2,2]
Output: [2]

Constraints:

1 <= nums1.length, nums2.length <= 1000
0 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 1000

Solution

Approach 1: Two Sets

Intuition

The naive approach would be to iterate along the first array nums1 and to check for each value if this value in nums2 or not. If yes - add the value to output. Such an approach would result in a pretty bad O(nÃ—m) time complexity, where n and m are arrays' lengths.

To solve the problem in linear time, let's use the structure set, which provides in/contains operation in O(1) time in average case.
The idea is to convert both arrays into sets, and then iterate over the smallest set checking the presence of each element in the larger set. Time complexity of this approach is O(n+m) in the 

Approach 2: Built-in Set Intersection

Intuition

There are built-in intersection facilities, which provide O(n+m) time complexity in the average case and O(nÃ—m) time complexity in the worst case.
