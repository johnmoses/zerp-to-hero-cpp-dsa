# N-ary tree
A binary tree is a rooted tree in which each node has no more than 2 children. Let's extend this definition to N-ary tree. If a tree is a rooted tree in which each node has no more than N children, it is called N-ary tree.

Trie is one of the most frequently used N-ary trees.

A binary tree can be traversed in preorder, inorder, postorder or level-order. Among these traversal methods, preorder, postorder and level-order traversal are suitable to be extended to an N-ary tree.
