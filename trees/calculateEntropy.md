Given a group of values, the entropy of the group is defined as the formula as following:



where P(x) is the probability of appearance for the value x.

The exercise is to calculate the entropy of a group. Here is one example.

the input group:  [1, 1, 2, 2]

the probability of value 1 is  2/4 = 1/2
the probability of value 2 is  2/4 = 1/2

As a result, its entropy can be obtained by:  - (1/2) * log2(1/2) - (1/2) * log2(1/2) = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1

Note: the precision of result would remain within 1e-6.
